HealthCare.gov
==============
**You're part of a start up company specializing in health care software services. Your company has been contacted by a country that is transitioning to a health care system similar to USA's "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act" (a.k.a. "Obamacare"). Their main concern is deploying a website for identifying health care plans so they are considering contracting your company to build it for them. They heard about the debacle of the HeathCare.gov's initial problems (and expensive fixes). Your boss has a sales pitch this afternoon to discuss the project with the client, but asks you to fill her in on how to assure the client that your company won't make the same mistakes in creating the website. Start with this article: [This Slide Shows Why Healthcare.gov Wouldn't Work At Launch](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/11/19/246132770/this-slide-shows-why-healthcare-gov-wouldnt-work-at-launch) and write an executive summary with an overview and suggestions**

Executive Summary I
-------------------
The healthcare.gov website flop was a problem that could have been avoided from the beginning. the process of developing software needs to be regulated from the start. Our company always uses an agile programming method to avoid unneeded overhead, which allows us to produce modules that are tested and functioning before they are released. Healthcare.gov used a waterfall technique that caused the website to end up not being as useful to the consumer as expected. This was caused by a continuous change in website requirements that caused nothing to be fully completed. Our technique uses a circular development path that allows us to continually keep tabs on the status and functionality of the website.

If we were to develop the healthcare.gov site from scratch our first step would be to develop a clear goal for the development cycle so that nothing is left behind. Instead of testing the product at the end of development we would test through the process to make sure we are on track for an effective solution. Our company always uses a gradual release method so that the product is tested by a small group instead of consumers which allows for bug fixes before they affect the entire target
market.

In conclusion it is apparent that our company’s agile method of development is far superior to the waterfall technique used by healthcare.gov. There is no doubt that a more thought out approach would be more effective.


Executive Summary II
--------------------
Here at Start-Up Company, Inc. we pride ourselves in developing rich, secure web applications.  In the Health Care industry there has been a push to provide online marketplaces for customers to choose the best plan for them.  The security risk that go along with providing this service is large, but we have the necessary experience with this front.  After the failed roll out of ObamaCare, there has been increased awareness in the field, regarding the reasons the ObamaCare website did not work. We have the answers.

Firstly, the ObamaCare web developers were using a horribly executed waterfall method of development.  We use an Agile framework to develop applications, which results in quicker turn around time for bugs that pop up, and faster response to changing requirements.

Another reason we are superior to the ObamaCare developers is that we understand the importance of a controlled roll out. Without the politicians breathing down our necks, we are able to provide a much cleaner, robust application in a controlled manner, which leads to less costly mistakes.

You can feel safe knowing that Start-Up Company, Inc has a robust team of developers that work together with clients to provide the most bang for your buck, with security a number one concern.
